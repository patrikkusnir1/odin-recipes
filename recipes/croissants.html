  <h1>Croissants</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>I wouldn't describe making homemade croissants as easy since there are multiple steps, and it does take at least
    half a
    day. But it's really not that hard either; and certainly simpler than flying to Paris, which is the only other way
    to
    enjoy these amazing pastries. This croissant recipe, with a helpful video, was adapted from one by Bruno Albouze,
    from
    The Real Deal (which he is).</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup warm water (100 degrees F or 38 degrees C)</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>¼ cup granulated white sugar</li>
    <li>3 ½ cups unbleached bread flour</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons butter, room temperature, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>2 sticks unsalted European-style butter</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle with yeast. Let yeast dissolve for 10 minutes. Add sugar
      and
      bread flour. Sprinkle with salt; add 6 tablespoons butter. Attach the bowl to the stand mixer. Mix dough with the
      dough
      hook just until butter is completely kneaded in and the dough forms a ball and pulls away cleanly from the sides
      of the
      bowl, 3 or 4 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a work surface and form into a semi-smooth ball. Place dough back in the mixer bowl; cover.
      Let rise
      in a warm spot until doubled, about 2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Push and press dough to deflate it, and form it into a
      rectangle. Fold
      into thirds by lifting one end over the middle third, and folding the other side onto the middle. Wrap in plastic
      wrap.
      Place on a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone mat. Refrigerate until chilled through, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Cut 2 sticks butter in half lengthwise and place slightly apart from each other on a length of parchment paper
      long
      enough to fold over the butter. Fold the parchment paper over the butter. Press butter down. Roll out with a
      rolling pin
      to a square about 8x8 inches. Refrigerate until a little chilled and just barely flexible, 10 or 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Roll dough out into a rectangle slightly wider than the butter slab and just over twice as long. Place butter on
      one
      half of the dough leaving about a 1-inch margin from the edge of the dough. Fold the other half of the dough over
      the
      butter. Dust work surface and dough with flour as needed.</li>
    <li>Press rolling pin down on dough to create ridges. Then roll out the ridges. Repeat this process. Keep pressing
      and
      rolling until dough is about the same size rectangle as you had before you folded it in half, dusting with just a
      bit of
      flour as necessary.
    </li>
    <li>Starting from the short side, fold one-third of dough over middle third. Then fold the other end over to form a
      small
      rectangle. Flatten out just slightly with rolling pin. Transfer to the silicone-lined baking sheet; cover with
      plastic
      wrap. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough back to work surface and repeat pressing and rolling technique until dough is the size of the
      previous
      larger rectangle. Fold into thirds again, starting from the short side. Press and roll slightly. Transfer back to
      lined
      baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Roll back out to a large rectangle. This time, fold dough in half. Then press and roll out into a 1/2-inch thick
      rectangle, using as little flour as needed to keep dough from sticking.</li>
    <li>Cut dough in half lengthwise using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter. Dust one piece with flour and roll out to a
      rectangle
      about 1/4 to 1/8 inch thick. Starting from one corner, cut the dough diagonally crosswise into 8 triangles using a
      pastry wheel. Starting with the bottom end of each triangle, roll each up toward the tip to form the croissant
      with the
      seam at the bottom. If necessary, use a bit of water to seal the tip to the rolled croissant.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the other half of the dough.</li>
    <li>Place shaped croissants on baking sheets lined with silicone mats. Whisk together egg and 1 tablespoon water to
      make the
      egg wash. Brush croissants with egg wash. Place in a warm area to allow them to rise, about 45 to 60 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush croissants gently but thoroughly again with egg wash.
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until beautifully browned, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack. Cool to room
      temperature before serving.</li>
  </ol>
